/* This file describes the typedefs that are used for integers and
   doubles. All the generated code uses these typedefs to enhance
   flexibility (in case the compiler is not Visual C++ 6 or the destination
   platform is not Windows 2000 on a Pentium 4).
   
   The user should be aware of the precision of these types, when
   these types are changed! For instance, when the destination platform 
   is a particular 8051 that does not support any doubles at all,
   one might change the XXDouble type into some float of 4 bytes.
   The results may then differ from the 20-sim results. It is advised
   to check these differences by running the code with both settings
   on the PC first (as far as this is possible).
   
   In 20-sim the following definitions are used:
   
    typedef XXDouble double;
    typedef XXInteger int;
   
   so that 
   
    XXDouble is 8 bytes (64 bits) with a range of [-1.7E+308, 1.7E+308]
    XXInteger is 4 bytes (32 bits) with a range of [-2147483648, 2147483647]
    XXCharacter is 1 byte (8 bits) with a value of [0, 255]
    XXBoolean is 1 byte (8 bits) with a value of 0 or 1
